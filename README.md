# Stock Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves downloading and analyzing stock market data for companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) using Python. The analysis includes visualizing stock price trends, calculating key technical indicators like Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands. Additionally, anomaly detection is performed using the Isolation Forest algorithm, and stock price forecasting is done using the Prophet model.
